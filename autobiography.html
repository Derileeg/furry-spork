	<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hi there! I'm an 18 year old entrepreneur trying to grow my cupcake business. I first got the idea when I invited my best friend over to taste 
	some treats I made for him. He enjoyed it so much, he convinced me to start my own business. I was pretty skeptical at first because I had no
	knowledge of how to handle a business; even start one. As time went by, it weighed heavy on my mind, so i set out on a journey to educate myself
	acquiring neccesary information from well known business owners. Besides that, I read books and watched multiple videos on Youtube.  A year passed
	and I was successful. My business, Princess cupcakes, was official! With faith I managed to achieve a goal I once thought was impossible.If we believe 
	in the things we imagine, we are capable of achieving them because what the mind can envision, WE can accomplish!Whatever your goal is, GO FOR IT.
