	<h1>BELIZE'S HERO</h1>
	<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Right Honourable George Cadle Price was the first Prime Minister of Belize and is considered one 
	of the principal architects of the country's independence, and is referred to by many as the Father of the Nation. Price was born on 15 January 1919 at the Price Family Home at number 3 Pickstock Street in Belize City, the eldest son and third of 10 children born to William and Irene Price n√©e Escalante.  This birth place was to remain his home until his death on 19 September 2011 - three day's short 
	of the 30th Anniversary of Belize's Independence - his crowning achievement.  Price was at the forefront of Belizean nationalist sentiment against British rule in the economic depression of the post war years, brought to a crisis by the devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949. He led the nationalist movement as a member of the Natives First Independent Group, which won four of the seven seats in the 1947 Belize municipal elections. Price won one seat and the other three seats were won by John Smith, Herbert Fuller and Karl Wade. Price was re-elected 
	for five consecutive terms until 1965, serving as the Mayor of Belize City from 1958 to 1962.
